To do:

- Refactor Sass code (it's pretty disgusting)

- Create user page

- Do front-page search engine

- Improve style (a little bit)



Did:

- Adapt write-review to mobile. Form takes full width. Buttons now side
  by side in mobile resolution. Had to do quite a bit of Sass customization;
  spectre.css not holding up.

- Make write-review container more compact:
  85% - 95% of current width
